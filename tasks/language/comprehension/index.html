          <h1>Language Comprehension</h1>

          <p>How do we understand what is spoken to us or what we
          read? Language comprehension is a process that we are all so
          extremely skilled at that it is often difficult to think about how
          it happens.  You read a sentence and immediately understand it,
          or so it seems. But as with many things in life, the true story
          is usually not a simple as it seems.  Researchers in a variety of
          disciplines, from psychology and linguistics to computer science
          and many more, have been trying for many years to understand
          exactly how we understand language. This page discusses just a
          few of the issues which researchers have explored, with an short
          example experimental task for each that you can complete. These experiments
          are designed to show you the methods that researchers use, as well
          as to give some insight into how the data from these experiments
          can inform our understanding of language comprehension.</p>

          <p>The process of understanding language is often thought of as being
          composed of several stages. When hearing or reading a sentence we
          first have to identify the individual sounds and letters, then identify and
          determine the meaning of the individual words, and finally analyze the
          overall structure of the sentence to determine how the individual
          words relate to one and other to determine the overall meaning of the
          sentence. While it seems reasonable to conclude that this process
          happens serially, with letters being identified first, then words, and
          finally the sentence understood, there is increasing evidence that
          this is not necessarily strictly the case. The meaning of a word can
          help us identify an unclear sound or letter within the word, or
          information from the sentence level can help to disambiguate
          what is meant by a word with several meanings. This interaction
          between the different stages of comprehension will be discussed in
          more detail in relation to the specific experiments below.</p>

          <p>The first two experiments below will address how we recognize
          individual words, either spoken or written. We won't be addressing the
          first step of comprehension, that of sound and letter recognition, but
          you can get more information on those <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_perception">here</a> and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)">here</a>. The second two
          experiments will address two different aspects about processing
          sentences.</p> 

          <a name="auditory"></a>
          <h2>Auditory Word Recognition</h2>

          <p>We are constantly surrounded by spoken language. Conversations with
          friends, talk-radio, your favorite television show, they are all
          filled with spoken language. How do we understand each of the words
          when we hear them? First, it's important to realize that when we hear
          a word, we do not hear it all at once, but spread out over time. Early
          on in the word, we can't be sure of it's final meaning, because at
          that point it could end up being several words. It's only after we
          have finished hearing the spoken word that we can be sure of what word
          it actually was.  But do we wait until the end of the word before we
          ascribe meaning to it? Probably not.  Instead, we try to predict what
          the word is going to be, based on what we've heard so far.</p>

          <p>Once we've heard the word in it's entirety, we still might not
          be sure of the actual meaning. Many, many words are ambiguous. The
          word 'saw' could refer to the tool used to cut things, or to the
          act of using one's eyes to view something. The experiment below
          explores how this ambiguity in language affects the time it takes
          to recognize individual words.</p>

          <div id="controls">
              <span id="auditory-word-rec"><button class="first">Run Experiment</button><button class="last">Jump to Results</button></span>
          </div>

          <a name="visual"></a>
          <h2>Visual Word Recognition</h2>

          <p>While recognizing written words seems like it should probably
          be very similar to recognizing spoken words, there are important
          differences. When we hear a work, the word enters our language
          system one sound at a time. In contrast, when reading, we can
          process the whole word at once. We don't need to incrementally
          process each part of the word, because it is all there for us to
          see in a single glance.</p>

          <p>If this were truly the case, and we could immediately and
          uniquely identify written words, we wouldn't expect the semantics,
          or meaning, of the word to influence this process. We simply
          see a word, and look up it's meaning, similar to how we use a
          dictionary. But is this actually how the language system works?</p>

          <p>One way to test this question is by having people read words
          and make judgements about them, and vary how semantic information
          can be applied when making those judgements. The experiment below
          shows one example of how this can be tested. Click on the button
          below to run through the experiment, or jump ahead to the results
          to see a detailed explanation of why it doesn't seem to be quite
          as simple as dictionary lookup!</p>

          </div>

          <a name="agree"></a>
          <h2>Agreement</h2>

          <p>Once we have identified the words in the sentence (or at least have
          identified them well enough to give us a place to start) we can begin
          to try to determine the overall idea being conveyed. Language is a
          very complex thing and there are often many ways to say the same
          thing:</p>

          <ul><li>"The man painted the tree that fell"</li> 
              <li>"The tree that fell was painted by the man"</li> 
              <li>"The man painted the fallen tree"</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Given all the ways we can express an idea, as well as embed
          ideas within other ideas, it is remarkable that we can understand
          language at all. The language processing system has learned to
          rely on many different cues to help in understanding what is
          meant by a given sentence. One such cue that is used regularly
          in many different ways is that of <em>agreement</em>. Language
          has a variety of dependencies built in that helps disambiguate
          complex sentences. One such agreement is that of gender between
          nouns and pronouns. The phrase 'Adam tripped and then he fell'
          follows the rules of gender agreement, 'Adam tripped and she fell'
          does not (unless there is another person we are talking about who
          also fell). Similarly, there are noun-verb agreement dependencies based
          on whether the subject of the sentence is singular or plural:
          'Adam tires of writing' makes sense, while 'Adam tire of writing'
          does not (but 'Students tire of writing' would.)

          <p>In order to use agreement to help disambiguate sentences,
          we have to be able to track them. The experiment below looks at
          how we are able to hold on to and track agreement while listening
          to sentences.</p>

          <div id="controls">
              <span id="agreement"><button class="first">Run Experiment</button><button class="last">Jump to Results</button></span>
          </div>

          <a name="relative"></a>
          <h2>Understanding Relative Clauses</h2>

          <p>The last aspect of language processing that we will look at
          why some sentences are harder to comprehend than others, even if they
          appear superficially to be very similar (i.e., they are the same
          number of words, with similar overall structure, etc.) A good example
          of this phenomenon occurs with relative clauses, subclauses in a
          sentence that modify a noun (show in italics below): </p>

          <ul><li>"The reporter <em>that attacked the senator</em> admitted the error"</li> 
                      <li>"The reporter <em>that the senator attacked</em> admitted the error"</li> 
          </ul>

          <p>Most people find the second sentence harder to read than the first.
          Why might this be? The final experiment examines this phenomenon by
          looking at the time it takes to read individual words in a
          sentence.</p>
